# Zillow Real Estate Agent Web Scraper

This is a web scraping project that extracts real estate agent information from Zillow's professional directory. The script uses Python and libraries like BeautifulSoup and pandas to scrape agent names, phone numbers, and the corresponding states from multiple URLs on Zillow's website.

## Getting Started

To get started with this project, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the Repository:** Clone this repository to your local machine using the following command:

   ```
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/zillow-agent-scraper.git
   ```

2. **Install Dependencies:** Make sure you have Python installed on your machine. Install the required Python packages using the following command:

   ```
   pip install requests beautifulsoup4 pandas
   ```

3. **Run the Script:** Open the `main.py` script using your preferred code editor. Adjust the `base_urls` list to include the URLs from which you want to scrape agent information. You can also customize the `user_agents` list to include different user agents for variety.

4. **Execute the Script:** Run the script using the following command:

   ```
   python main.py
   ```

5. **Output:** The script will scrape agent information from the provided URLs and store it in a CSV file named `agents.csv` in the same directory.

## Notes

- Please ensure that you are familiar with the legal and ethical considerations of web scraping. Review the terms of use and robots.txt file of the websites you are scraping to ensure compliance.

- The script randomizes user agents and introduces delays between requests to avoid overloading the server and to mimic more natural browsing behavior.

- The scraped data is stored in a pandas DataFrame and then saved as a CSV file for easy analysis and further processing.
